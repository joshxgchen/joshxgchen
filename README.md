# Hello, I'm Josh! 👋

I'm a fourth-year student at Simon Fraser University with a passion for technology, software development, and development. With a background in computer science and a strong foundation in software engineering, I'm on a journey to make a meaningful impact through code and innovation.

**Note: I had access to private Github accounts during my internships, and thus these accounts/contributions are not all public. ANY FINANCIAL-RELATED REPOS ARE PRIVATE, as well as projects that contain my API key [ie: Spotify]**

## 💼 Previous Internships

### Coinbase (Fall 2022)
At Coinbase, I had the opportunity to work on projects in cryptocurrency. I contributed to the development of secure and user-friendly customer products, working on the ecosystem team. Contributions impacted the Wallet app on both Mobile (iOS/Android) as well as Extension (web).

### WillowTree (Summer 2022)
During my internship at WillowTree, I was part of a dynamic team that focused on crafting exceptional mobile and web experiences for clients across various industries. I gained valuable insights into mobile app development and user experience design, working and helping fellow interns with products such as McGraw Hill, Dairy Queen, and HBO. 

### Incognito Software (Spring 2022)
My experience at Incognito Software exposed me to the world of network management solutions. I worked on improving network performance and reliability, enhancing my skills in networking, software testing, and software development.

## 📚 My Interests

Apart from coding, I have a deep passion for staying active and exploring the outdoors. Here are some of my favorite activities:
